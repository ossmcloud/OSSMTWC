TODO:
-----
    00. new SRF => big files will cause the UI to take time to save
        srf => preview file not work for csv

    

TODO-NEXT:
----------
    00. SRF Type => what is this??? we do not have oit in Radix
            
    02. Finalise the site info page panels: 
            add missing fields/panels
    
    03. Space Request: 
        implement file add/edit/delete
        add submit button if status is 'Draft' or 'FeedbackIssued'
            NOTE: if status is FeedbackIssued then set to 'Resubmitted'
        if status not 'Draft' or 'FeedbackIssued' then the user should no longer be able to edit the request
    03. Locator Panel => Access Request => the table should show site access requests (i.e.: work lite the space request page)
    04. implement functionalities:
            Space Request (SRF)
            Space Access Request (SAF)
            ...

    04. OSSMTWC - Profile   
        each employee or customer or customer contact must be associated with a profile
        we should automate this as follow:
            new employees => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            new customers => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            new contact => if possible do same as above
            new vendors => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            




TEST DATA WE NEED:
------------------

OSSMTWC - Equipment List
We should have a table that tells us what customers a vendor can work on behalf of

OSSMTWC - SRF Item Step Type => should rename to something more meaningful:
    TME     Tower Mounted Eq
    ATME    Additional Tower Mounted Eq
    GIE     Ground & Indoor Eq

OSSMTWC - Profile
Map to employees / customers|vendors / customer|vendorS contact

ADD FEATURE:
------------

01. Create Files:
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}_sl.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}_cs.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\js\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\modules\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}Utils.js

02. Deploy suitelet (get script id)
    NOTE: set external role: allow TWC Customer Center

03. Add record to table: OSSMTWC - Role Feature List




________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

TO REVIEW:
----------

UI Panels:
    Tables: MAYBE would be wise to have the sub list lazy loading on screen (user TableControl in this case)


Radix Role is assigned to the NS Role
    This means that a user could assign an 'Admin' radix role to a customer or vendor which should not be done under any circumstances
    We need to figure out a way to avoid this (cannot use Sourcind on the custom field as 'Center Type' is not available as List/Record option)
