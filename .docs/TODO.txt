TODO-NEXT:
----------
    00. SRF Type => what is this??? we do not have oit in Radix
    
    04. implement functionalities:
            Space Request (SRF)
            Space Access Request (SAF)
            ...

    04. OSSMTWC - Profile
        each employee or customer or customer contact must be associated with a profile
        we should automate this as follow:
            new employees => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            new customers => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            new contact => if possible do same as above
            new vendors => create the profile record on save and ask user to complete 
            




TEST DATA WE NEED:
------------------

We should have a table that tells us what customers a vendor can work on behalf of

OSSMTWC - SRF Item Step Type => should rename to something more meaningful:
    TME     Tower Mounted Eq
    ATME    Additional Tower Mounted Eq
    GIE     Ground & Indoor Eq

OSSMTWC - Profile
Map to employees / customers|vendors / customer|vendorS contact

TO REVIEW:
----------
SRF 
    big files will cause the UI to take time to save
    preview file not work for csv
    if re-uploading same file increase version


Radix Role is assigned to the NS Role
    This means that a user could assign an 'Admin' radix role to a customer or vendor which should not be done under any circumstances
    We need to figure out a way to avoid this (cannot use Sourcing on the custom field as 'Center Type' is not available as List/Record option)
