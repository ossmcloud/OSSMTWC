User Pref.

Site Locator:
    site table => 
        add link to open SAF 
        the list cannot be navigated very well as we only see few records, figure out a way to improve (possibly without scrolling the entire page)

    Find by location
    search coordinates or set search point manually













TODO-DATA:
----------
    Set up IE counties
    Site Table: 
        LAT/LNG were inverted in import

        Address should be expanded as 'Address 1, 2,3,4 County, ZIP...'
        Add Region field
        County should not be free text
        What about fields:
            Structure (we have a Structure List but that's wrong)
            Building
            Indoor Space
            Region
            



ADD FEATURE:
------------

01. Create Files:
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}_sl.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}_cs.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\js\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}.js
    FileCabinet\SuiteScripts\OSSMTWC\ui\modules\oTWC_{FEATURE_NAME}Utils.js

02. Deploy suitelet (get script id)
    NOTE: set external role: allow TWC Customer Center

03. Add record to table: OSSMTWC - Role Feature List





TO REVIEW:
----------

Radix Role is assigned to the NS Role
    This means that a user could assign an 'Admin' radix role to a customer or vendor which should not be done under any circumstances
    We need to figure out a way to avoid this (cannot use Sourcind on the custom field as 'Center Type' is not available as List/Record option)
